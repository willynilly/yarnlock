Fast and correct OpenStreetMap shortlink encoder and decoder implementation in Rust with Python bindings. Shortlinks allow you to represent a location on the map with a short code.

## Installation

The recommended installation method is through the PyPI package manager. The project is implemented in Rust, offering excellent performance characteristics. Several pre-built binary wheels are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, with support for both x64 and ARM architectures.

```sh
pip install yarnlock
```

## Basic usage

```py
from yarnlock import shortlink_encode
shortlink_encode(0.054, 51.510, 9)  # -> '0EEQhq--'
shortlink_encode(19.579, 51.876, 19)  # -> '0OP4tR~rx'
shortlink_encode(0, 0, 23)  # ValueError: Invalid zoom: must be between 0 and 22, got 23

from yarnlock import shortlink_decode
shortlink_decode('0EEQhq--')  # -> (0.054, 51.510, 9)
shortlink_decode('0OP4tR~rx')  # -> (19.579, 51.876, 19)
shortlink_decode('X')  # ValueError: Invalid shortlink: too short
```
